This repository contains a collection of Java programs covered during my second semester of the BCSIT course. 
It includes implementations of fundamental concepts such as object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, file handling, exception handling, and basic data structures. 
Each program is written with clarity and proper structure, following the concepts taught in class, making this repository a useful reference for revision, practice, and for anyone beginning to learn Java at an undergraduate level.
